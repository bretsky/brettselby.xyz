put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said that's a lie
just a boy in a chevy truck
that had a tendency of gettin' stuck
on back roads at night
and i was right there beside him all summer long
and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

but when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me

september saw a month of tears
and thankin' god that you weren't here
to see me like that
but in a box beneath my bed
is a letter that you never read
from three summers back
it's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
and lookin' back on all of that it's nice to believe

when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me

and i'm back for the first time since then
i'm standin' on your street
and there's a letter left on your doorstep
and the first thing that you'll read is

when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
someday you'll turn your radio on
i hope it takes you back to that place
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me

oh think of me

he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said that's a lie%new_song%state the obvious i didn't get my perfect fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that i'm obsessive and crazy
that's fine i'll tell mine that you're gay
by the way

i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak
who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned you're
just another picture to burn

there's no time for tears
i'm just sitting here planning my revenge
there's nothing stopping me
from going out with all of your best friends
and if you come around saying sorry to me
my daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

and if you're missing me
you'd better keep it to yourself
'cause coming back around here
would be bad for your health

'cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak
who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
in case you haven't heard
i really really hate that

you're just another picture to burn

that i want and i'm needing everything that we should be
i'll bet she's beautiful that girl he talks about
and she's got everything that i have to live without

drew talks to me i laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
that i can't even see anyone when he's with me
he says he's so in love he's finally got it right
i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at night

he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing don't know why i do

drew walks by me can he tell that i can't breathe
and there he goes so perfectly
the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she better hold him tight give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

so i drive home alone
as i turn out the light
i'll put his picture down
and maybe get some sleep tonight

'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing don't know why i do
he's the time taken up but there's never enough
and he's all that i need to fall into

drew looks at me i fake a smile so he won't see%new_song%i don't know what i want so don't ask me
cause i'm still trying to figure it out
don't know what's down this road i'm just walking
trying to see through the rain coming down
even though i'm not the only one
who feels the way i do

i'm alone on my own and that's all i know
i'll be strong i'll be wrong oh but life goes on
oh i'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

got the radio on my old blue jeans
and i'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
feeling lucky today got the sunshine
could you tell me what more do i need
and tomorrow's just a mystery oh yeah
but that's ok

maybe i'm just a girl on a mission
but i'm ready to fly

i'm alone on my own and that's all i know
i'll be strong i'll be wrong oh but life goes on
oh i'm alone on my own and that's all i know
oh i'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

oh i'm just a girl
oh i'm just a girl oh oh
oh i'm just a girl%new_song%you have a way of coming easily to me
and when you take you take the very best of me
so i start a fight cause i need to feel something
and you do what you want cause i'm not what you wanted

oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
just walk away no use defending words that you will never say
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through
i've never been anywhere cold as you

you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
and i stood there loving you and wished them all away
and you come away with a great little story
of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

you never did give a damn thing honey but i cried cried for you
and i know you wouldn't have told nobody if i died died for you
died for you

oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
every smile you fake is so condescending
counting all the scars you made
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through
i've never been anywhere cold as you%new_song%i didn't know what i would find
when i went looking for a reason i know
i didn't read between the lines
and baby i've got nowhere to go
i tried to take the road less traveled by
but nothing seems to work the first few times
am i right

so how can i ever try to be better
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside

you saw me there but never knew
i would give it all up to be
a part of this a part of you
and now it's all too late so you see
you could've helped if you had wanted to
but no one notices until it's too
late to do anything

so how can i ever try to be better
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside%new_song%seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
is the face in the mirror looking back at you
you walk around here thinking you're not pretty
but that's not true cause i know you

hold on baby you're losing it
the water's high you're jumping into it
and letting go and no one knows
that you cry but you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone

i guess it's true that love was all you wanted
cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
hoping it will end up in his pocket
but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
oh cause it's not his price to pay
not his price to pay

you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone oh
goodbye baby
with a smile baby baby

the highlight of my day
i'm taking pictures in my mind
so i can save them for a rainy day
it's hard to make a conversation

if you and i are a story
that never gets told
if what you are is a daydream
i'll never get to hold

na na na na na%new_song%it's strange to think the songs we used to sing
the smiles the flowers everything is gone
yesterday i found out about you
even now just looking at you feels wrong

you say that you'd take it all back given one chance
it was a moment of weakness and you said yes

you should've said no you should've gone home
you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
you should've known that word with what you did with her
get back to me get back to me
and i should've been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should've said no baby and you might still have me

you can see that i've been crying
baby you know all the right things to say
but do you honestly expect me to believe
we could ever be the same

you say that the past is the past you need one chance
it was a moment of weakness and you said yes

i can't resist
before you go tell me this
was it worth it
was she worth this

no no no no%new_song%she said i was seven and you were nine
i looked at you like the stars that shined
in the sky the pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my

take me back to the house in the backyard tree
said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
you never did you never did
take me back when our world was one block wide
i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
just two kids you and i
oh my my my my

well i was sixteen when suddenly
i wasn't that little girl you used to see
but your eyes still shined like pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
they never believed we'd really fall in love
and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
and said oh my my my

take me back to the creek beds we turned up
two am riding in your truck and all i need is you next to me
take me back to the time we had our very first fight
the slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
you stayed outside till the morning light
oh my my my my

a few years had gone and come around
we were sitting at our favorite spot in town
and you looked at me got down on one knee

take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came and our mamas cried
you said i do and i did too
take me home where we met so many years before
we'll rock our babies on that very front porch
after all this time you and i

i'll be eighty seven you'll be eighty nine
i'll still look at you like the stars that shine
in the sky oh my my my%new_song%i was riding shotgun
with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
he's got a one hand feel
on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
i look around turn the radio down
he says baby is something wrong
i say nothing
i was just thinking
how we don't have a song
and he says

our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin' out late tapping on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date man i didn't kiss her when i should have
and when i got home  'fore i said amen
asking god if he could play it again

i was walking up
the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong
and been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway
well on my way
to my lovin' bed
i almost didn't notice
all the roses
and the note that said

our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin' out late tapping on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date man i didn't kiss her when i should have
and when i got home  'fore i said amen
asking god if he could play it again

i've heard every album listened to the radio
waited for something to come along
that was as good as our song

'cause our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin' out late tapping on his window
when we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date man i didn't kiss him when i should have
and when i got home  'fore i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
play it again

oh yeah
oh oh yeah

i was riding shotgun
with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
i grabbed a pen
and an old napkin
and i wrote down our song%new_song%friday night beneath the stars
in a field behind your yard
you and i are paintin' pictures in the sky
and sometimes we don't say a thing
just listen to the crickets sing
everything i need is right here by my side
and i know everything about you
i don't wanna live without you

i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i'm only trying to let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me when i'm with you

just a small town boy and girl
livin' in a crazy world
tryin' to figure out what is and isn't true
and i don't try to hide my tears
the secrets or my deepest fears
through it all nobody gets me like you do
and you know everything about me
you say that you can't live without me

when i'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself
only you can tell

that i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i'm only trying to let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me
who i wanna be
well i'm only me when i'm with you
with you
uh huh

light up when you smile
she'll never notice how you stop and stare
whenever she walks by

and you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
but you are everything to me

i just wanna show you
she don't even know you
she's never gonna love you like i want to
and you just see right through me
if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful
miracle
unbelievable
instead of just invisible

there's a fire inside of you
that can't help but shine through
she's never gonna see the light
no matter what you do

and all i think about is how to make you think of me
and everything that we could be

like shadows in a faded light
oh we're invisible
i just wanna open your eyes
and make you realize

why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apartnow
why would you wanna make the very first scar

maybe i should've seen the signs should've read the writing on the wall
and realized by the distance in your eyes that i would be the one to fall
no matter what you say i still can't believe
that you would walk away
it don't make sense to me but

why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now

that you'll come in with the rain

i've watched you so long
screamed your name
i don't know what else i can say

but i'll leave my window open
'cus i'm too tired at night for all these games

that you'll come in with the rain

i could go back to every laugh
but i don't wanna' go there anymore%new_song%his is wrong but i can't help but feel like
there ain't nothing more right babe
misty morning comes again and i can't
help but wish i could see your face
and i knew from the first note played
i'd be breaking all my rules to see you
you smile that beautiful smile and
all the girls in the front row scream your name

so dim that spotlight tell me things like
i can't take my eyes off of you
i'm no one special just another
wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

good morning loneliness comes around when i'm not
dreaming about you
when my world wakes up today
you'll be in another town
and i knew when i saw your face i'd be
counting down the ways to see you
you smile that beautiful smile and
all the girls in the front row scream your name

so dim that spotlight tell me things like
i can't take my eyes off of you
i'm no one special just another
wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

you played in bars you play guitar
i'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
and you'll never see sing me to sleep
every night from the radio

so dim that spotlight tell me things like
i can't take my eyes off of you
i'm no one special just another
wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar
sweet sweet superstar superstar%new_song%in the heat of the fight i walked away
ignoring words that you were saying
trying to make me stay
i said this time i've had enough
and you've called a hundred times
but i'm not picking up

'cause i'm so mad i might tell you that it's over
but if you look a little closer

i said leave but all i really want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming i'm in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door

me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
going through the photographs staring at the phone
i keep going back over things we both said
and i remember the slamming door and all the things that i misread

so babe if you know everything tell me why you couldn't see
when i left i wanted you to chase after me

yeah i said leave but all i really want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming i'm in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door

and i'll scream out the window
i can't even look at you
i don't need you but i do i do i do
i say there's nothing you can say to make this right again
i mean it i mean it
what i mean is

i said leave but baby all i want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming i'm in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
and don't you leave 'cause i know
all i need is on the other side of the door

with your face and the beautiful eyes
and the conversation with the little white lies
and the faded picture of a beautiful night
you carry me from your car up the stairs
and i broke down crying was she worth this mess
after everything and that little black dress
after everything i must confess i need you%new_song%there's somethin' 'bout the way
the street looks when it's just rained
there's a glow off the pavement
you walk me to the car
and you know i wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot
yeah
oh yeah

we're drivin' down the road
i wonder if you know
i'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
but you're just so cool
run your hands through your hair
absent mindedly makin' me want you

and i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless

so baby drive slow
'til we run out of road in this one horse town
i wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
you put your eyes on me
in this moment now capture it remember it

'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless

well you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake
i'm not usually this way
but you pull me in and i'm a little more brave
it's the first kiss
it's flawless
really something
it's fearless

oh yeah

'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless

'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless

oh oh
oh yeah%new_song%you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
it's the morning of your very first day
you say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
try and stay out of everybody's way
it's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
you know i haven't seen you around before

'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen
feeling like there nothing to figure out
well count to ten take it in
this is life before you know who you're gonna be
fifteen

you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough you're best friends
laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
we'll be out of here as soon as we can
and then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
and you're feeling like flying
and you're mommas waiting up and you think he's the one
and you're dancing round your room when the night ends
when the night ends

'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
when you're fifteen and your first kiss
makes your head spin round but
in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy of the football team
but i didn't know it at fifteen

when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then i swore i was gonna marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine

and abigail gave everything she had to a boy
who changed his mind and we both cried

'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen don't forget to look before you fall
i've found that time can heal most anything
and you just might find who you're supposed to be
i didn't know who i was supposed to be at fifteen

la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la

your very first day
take a deep breath girl
take a deep breath as you walk through those doors%new_song%we were both young when i first saw you
i close my eyes and the flashback starts
i'm standing there on a balcony in summer air

see the lights see the party the ball gowns
see you make your way through the crowd
and say hello 
little did i know

that you were romeo you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said stay away from juliet
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you please don't go
and i said

romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting all that's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story baby just say yes

so i sneak out to the garden to see you
we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
so close your eyes escape this town for a little while
oh oh

'cause you were romeo   i was a scarlet letter
and my daddy said stay away from juliet
but you were everything to me
i was begging you please don't go
and i said

romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting all that's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story baby just say yes

romeo save me they're trying to tell me how to feel
this love is difficult but it's real
don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess
it's a love story baby just say yes

oh oh

i got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town
and i said

romeo save me i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you but you never come
is this in my head i don't know what to think
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

marry me juliet you'll never have to be alone
i love you and that's all i really know
i talked to your dad   go pick out a white dress
it's a love story baby just say yes

oh oh oh oh oh

'cause we were both young when i first saw you%new_song%hey stephen
i know looks can be deceiving
but i know i saw a light in you
and as we walked
we were talking –
i didn't say half the things i wanted to

of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
i'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
hey stephen
boy you might have me believing
i don't always have to be alone

'cause i can't help it if you look like an angel

they're dimming the street lights
you're perfect for me why aren't you here tonight
i'm waiting alone now so come on and come out and pull me near to shine shine shine

hey stephen
i could give you fifty reasons
why i should be the one you choose
all those other girls

as i paced back and forth all this time
cause i honestly believed in you
holding on
the days drag on
stupid girl
i should have known i should have known

i'm not a princess this ain't a fairy tale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

baby i was naive
got lost in your eyes
and never really had a chance
my mistake i didn't know to be in love
you had to fight to have the upper hand
i had so many dreams
about you and me
happy endings
now i know

i'm not a princess this ain't a fairy tale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

and there you are on your knees
begging for forgiveness begging for me
just like i always wanted but i'm so sorry

cause i'm not your princess this ain't a fairytale
i'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
this is a big world that was a small town
there in my rear view mirror disappearing now
and it's too late for you and your white horse
now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now

oh whoa whoa whoa
try and catch me now
oh it's too late
to catch me now%new_song%you're on the phone with your girlfriend
she's upset she's going off about something that you said
'cause she doesn't get your humor like i do

i'm in the room it's a typical tuesday night
i'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
and she'll never know your story like i do

but she wears short skirts
i wear t shirts
she's cheer captain
and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

if you could see
that i'm the one
who understands you
been here all along
so why can't you see
you belong with me
you belong with me

walk in the streets with you in your worn out jeans
i can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
hey isn't this easy

and you've got a smile
that could light up this whole town
i haven't seen it in a while
since she brought you down

you say you're fine i know you better than that
hey what you doing with a girl like that

she wears high heels
i wear sneakers
she's cheer captain
and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time

if you could see
that i'm the one
who understands you
been here all along
so why can't you see
you belong with me

standing by and waiting at your backdoor
all this time how could you not know baby
you belong with me
you belong with me

oh i remember you driving to my house
in the middle of the night
i'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're 'bout to cry
i know your favorite songs
and you tell me about your dreams
think i know where you belong
think i know it's with me

can't you see
that i'm the one
who understands you

music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie

cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
now i don't know what to be without you around

and we know it's never simple never easy
never a clean break no one here to save me

and i can't breathe without you
but i have to
breathe without you

every little bump in the road i tried to swerve

i believe it was a tuesday when i caught your eye
and we caught onto something
i hold onto the night
you looked me in the eye
and told me you loved me

were you just kidding
'cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
we almost never speak
i don't feel welcome anymore
baby what happened please tell me
'cause one second it was perfect now you're half way out the door

and i stare at the phone
he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
oh and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always

was i out of line
did i say something way too honest
made you run and hide
like a scared little boy
i looked into your eyes
thought i knew you for a minute now i'm not so sure

so here's to everything
coming down to nothing
here's to silence
that cuts me to the core
where is this going
thought i knew for a minute but i don't anymore

and i stare at the phone
he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
oh and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always

you didn't mean it baby
i don't think so

back up baby back up
did you forget everything
back up baby back up
did you forget everything

'cause it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always

oh i stare at the phone
he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when we said forever and always

and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always

you didn't mean it baby
you said forever and always yeah%new_song%i'm five years old
it's getting cold
i've got my big coat on

i hear your laugh
and look up smiling at you
i run and run

past the pumpkin patch
and the tractor rides
look now    the sky is gold
i hug your legs and fall asleep
on the way home

i don't know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you're not scared of anything at all
don't know if snow white's house is near or far away
but i know i had the best day
with you today

i'm thirteen now
and don't know how my friends
could be so mean

i come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys

and we drive and drive
until we've found a town
far enough away

and we talk and window shop
until i've forgotten all their names

i don't know who i'm gonna talk to
now at school
i know i'm laughing on the car ride home with you
don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
but i know i had the best day
with you today

i have an excellent father
his strength is making me stronger
god smiles on my little brother
inside and out
he's better than i am

i grew up in a pretty house
and i had space to run
and i had the best days with you

there is a video
i found from back when i was three
you set up a paint set in the kitchen
and you're talking to me

it's the age of princesses and pirate ships
and the seven dwarfs
daddy's smart
and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

now i know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you were on my side
even when i was wrong
and i love you for giving me your eyes
staying back and watching me shine

and i didn't know if you knew
so i'm taking this chance to say
that i had the best day
with you today%new_song%and it's a sad picture the final blow hits you
somebody else gets what you wanted again and
you know it's all the same another time and place
repeating history and you're getting sick of it
but i believe in whatever you do
and i'll do anything to see it through

because these things will change
can you feel it now
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution the time will come
for us to finally win
and we'll sing hallelujah we'll sing hallelujah

so we've been outnumbered
raided and now cornered
it's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
we're getting stronger now
find things they never found
they might be bigger
but we're faster and never scared
you can walk away say we don't need this
but there's something in your eyes
says we can beat this

because these things will change
can you feel it now
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution the time will come
for us to finally win
and we'll sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah

tonight we stand get off our knees
fight for what we've worked for all these years
and the battle was long it's the fight of our lives
but we'll stand up champions tonight

it was the night things changed
can you see it now
these walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
it's a revolution throw your hands up
cause we never gave in
and we sang hallelujah we sang hallelujah
hallelujah
